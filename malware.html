            <h2 class="about-header">What is Malware?</h2>
            <p>Malware, short for malicious software, is a broad term that encompasses any software designed to cause harm to computer systems, networks, or users. 
            It's created by cybercriminals with malevolent intent and can vary in complexity and severity. 
            Malware can include viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware, adware, and more. 
            In this section of the many different malware, we are focusing on viruses, worms, trojans, ransomwares, and spywares.</p>

            <h2 class="about-header">How Does Malware Work?</h2>
            <p>Malware operates in several ways to achieve its objectives. It can modify, delete, or steal data; disrupt system performance; control infected machines remotely; or use internal algorithms to further propagate and evade detection. 
                It often goes unnoticed until it has already caused significant damage.</p>

        <div class="about-div">
            <h2 class="about-header">How is Malware Distributed?</h2>
            <p>Malware exploits vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks to gain entry. 
                It can be distributed via infected email attachments, compromised websites, peer-to-peer networks, infected USB drives, social engineering tactics, and more. 
                Once inside a system, it may release additional payloads or download other malware components.</p>

            <h2 class="about-header">About Viruses</h2>
            <p>A virus is a type of malware that attaches to another program and, when executed, usually inadvertently by the user, replicates itself by modifying other computer programs and infecting them with its own bits of code. 
                Viruses can spread across systems when users share infected files. They often cause damage to the system, corrupting files or affecting system performance. 
                Viruses can also create a backdoor for cybercriminals to access the system, leading to potential data theft. </p>

            <h2 class="about-header">About Trojans</h2>
            <p>Trojan, or Trojan horse, is a type of malware that disguises itself as a legitimate software or file to trick users into installing it. Unlike viruses, Trojans do not replicate themselves but instead create a backdoor for cybercriminals to access the system. 
                Once installed, a Trojan can perform actions such as modifying, deleting, or stealing data, disrupting system performance, or creating a backdoor for additional malware components to be installed. 
                Trojans are commonly distributed through infected email attachments, malicious downloads, or compromised websites.</p>

            <h2 class="about-header">About Worms</h2>
            <p>A worm is a malware which spreads from one device to another with little or no human involvement. 
                First, a worm will find a new host and exploit any flaws in the machine's security, then it will copy itself onto the machine (self-replication) through a network connection. Then it will repeat these steps to breach another device.
                A worm can initially spread through fraudulent emails, shared access via a network, file sharing, security holes, and an external device like a USB stick. 
                Additionally, a worm can carry out actions such as deleting files, stealing personal data, creating a backdoor, taking up hard drive storage, and overloading networks.

            <h2 class="about-header">About Ransomware</h2>
            <p>Ransomware is malware in which an attacker will threaten the victim by removing some aspect of a device, and demand them to pay a ransom to get access back.
                An individual can get this type of malware through malicious advertising, spam emailing with an infected attachment, and phishing scams. 
                Different types of ransomware vary in severity. Scareware is the least severe; this is where an individual gets a pop-up in which they are messaged to pay to remove a fake malware. 
                Screen lockers are more severe as they lock victims out of their PCs and demand payment. While the highest severity is called encrypting ransomware where the attacker will encrypt a victim's files and will only decrypt them once a payment has been made.

            <h2 class="about-header">About Spyware</h2>
            <p>Spyware is a type of software that is designed to collect information about a user's activities without their knowledge or consent. It can be embedded in various types of software and applications, and is often used by cybercriminals to steal sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal information. Spyware can be delivered to your device through various methods, such as software backdoors, phishing, spoofing, manipulative marketing, software packages, Trojans, and mobile apps 1.

            </p>
            <p>The process of spyware operation typically follows a three-step process:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Infiltration</p>   
                <li>Monitoring and Capture</p>    
                <li>Sending or Selling</p> 
            </ul>
