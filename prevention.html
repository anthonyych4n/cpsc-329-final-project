                Malware exhibits distinct characteristics and employs diverse infection methods depending on its type. The evolution of spread techniques makes detecting and eliminating these threats progressively challenging. 
                Despite this challenge, understanding the unique traits of each malware type enables the identification of specific vulnerabilities.Consequently, we can create methodologies
                that are tailored to combat each type of malware. Our focus will now shift to examining the primary strategies employed against these different forms of malicious software.

                Installing Antivirus and Anti-malware software
            </h2>
            <p>
                Detecting and removing malware involves the use of antivirus and anti-malware software. These programs will help 
                protect your computer and other devices from viruses and malicious software. The most common antivirus and anti-malware
                programs are Malwarebytes, BitDefender, AVG AntiVirus, McAfee, and Microsoft Defender Antivirus.

                Keep Software and Operating Systems Up-To-Date
            </h2>
            <p>
                You must keep your operating systems and software up-to-date as these updates often provide 
                new and improved security patches and bug fixes. This will help keep your system better equipped to prevent any 
                possible malicious infection from occurring.

                Back-Up Important Data Often
            </h2>
            <p>
                Backing up your most important data, if not all of it, will help ensure that you can easily transfer your data 
                to a separate device in case your current device becomes vulnerable to malicious threats. It is important to note 
                that these backups must be stored in a secure location, preferably some sort of external storage system like a 
                solid state drive.

                Keeping yourself updated and educated on the current malware/cybersecurity threats will help keep you alert and aware 
                of the common ways you could expect to be attacked. Passing this knowledge to those around you will also decrease 
                your risk of getting a malware infection.

                Double-Check Unfamiliar Links and Suspicious E-Mails/Text Messages
            </h2>
            <p>
                Phishing constitutes a malicious endeavor wherein attackers mimic trustworthy service providers, companies, or individuals with the aim of acquiring personal and sensitive data or installing malware. 
                Suspicious emails, text messages, and phone calls are prevalent avenues for these fraudulent activities. 
                Additionally, attackers exploit malicious websites to obtain sensitive information or deploy malware. 
                Therefore, it is crucial to exercise caution by verifying unfamiliar links encountered while browsing the internet and approaching with skepticism when faced with dubious phone calls, emails, or text messages.
