        <p>Content about prevention methods goes here.</p>
        <p>Each type of malware has unique characteristics and methods of infection. The methods used to spread malware are constantly
            evolving, making it increasingly difficult to detect and remove these malicious threats. These unique characteristics, 
            however, allow us to pinpoint the weaknesses of each type of virus. Consequently, we can create methodologies
            that are tailored to combat each type of virus. We will now analyze the main strategies used against each virus.

        <p>
            Viruses are a type of malware that attach themselves to other programs or files as they're executed. Viruses copy themselves
            and spread, unknowingly, to other computer systems. This is done by attaching itself to programs, files/documents, and by external
            devices used for file sharing such as USBs.
