            <h2 class="about-header">What is Malware?</h2>
            <p>Malware, a condensed form of malicious software, is a comprehensive term encompassing any software crafted to inflict harm on computer systems, networks, or users. 
                It is engineered by cybercriminals with malicious intentions and manifests in a spectrum of complexities and severities. 
                Among the myriad types of malware—including viruses, trojans, worms, ransomware, spyware, adware, botnets, and others—this section specifically concentrates on viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, and spyware.</p>

            <h2 class="about-header">How Does Malware Work?</h2>
            <p>Malware operates in several ways to achieve its objectives. It can modify, delete, or steal data; disrupt system performance; control infected machines remotely; or use internal algorithms to further propagate and evade detection. 
                It usually will go unnoticed until it has already caused lots of damage to a device.</p>

        <div class="about-div">
            <h2 class="about-header">How is Malware Distributed?</h2>
            <p>Malware will exploit faulty security in computer systems and networks to get access into a device.  
                Malware can be spread through email via infected attachments, compromised websites, network access, infected external drives, and many more. 
                Once it is inside a system, it could potentially download other malware parts or release even more payloads.</p>

            <h2 class="about-header">About Viruses</h2>
            <p>A virus, a subtype of malware, attaches itself to existing programs. When triggered, typically unknowingly by the user, it replicates by altering other computer programs and implanting them with its code fragments. 
                The spread of viruses occurs through the sharing of infected files among users, posing a risk of system damage. 
                These malicious entities can corrupt files, compromise system performance, and even establish a backdoor for cybercriminals to potentially engage in unauthorized access which paves the way for data theft. </p>

            <h2 class="about-header">About Trojans</h2>
            <p>A Trojan, also known as a Trojan horse, is a form of malware that camouflages itself as genuine software or a legitimate file, deceiving users into unwittingly installing it. Unlike viruses, Trojans don't replicate on their own but instead establish a secret entry point for cybercriminals to breach the system. Once infiltrated, a Trojan can execute various actions, including data modification, deletion, or theft, as well as disrupting system performance or creating a backdoor for the installation of additional malware components. Trojans are frequently disseminated through infected email attachments, compromised websites, or malicious downloads.</p>

            <h2 class="about-header">About Worms</h2>
            <p>A worm is a malware which spreads from one device to another with little or no human involvement. 
                First, a worm will find a new host and exploit any flaws in the machine's security, then it will copy itself onto the machine (self-replication) through a network connection. Then it will repeat these steps to breach another device.
                A worm can initially spread through fraudulent emails, shared access via a network, file sharing, security holes, and an external device like a USB stick. 
                Additionally, a worm can carry out actions such as deleting files, stealing personal data, creating a backdoor, taking up hard drive storage, and overloading networks.

            <h2 class="about-header">About Ransomware</h2>
            <p>Ransomware is malware in which an attacker will threaten the victim by removing some aspect of a device, and demand them to pay a ransom to get access back.
                An individual can get this type of malware through malicious advertising, spam emailing with an infected attachment, and phishing scams. 
                Different types of ransomware vary in severity. Scareware is the least severe; this is where an individual gets a pop-up in which they are messaged to pay to remove a fake malware. 
                Screen lockers are more severe as they lock victims out of their PCs and demand payment. While the highest severity is called encrypting ransomware where the attacker will encrypt a victim's files and will only decrypt them once a payment has been made.

            <h2 class="about-header">About Spyware</h2>
            <p>Spyware is a type of software that is designed to collect information about a user's activities without their knowledge or consent. It can be embedded in various types of software and applications, and is often used by cybercriminals to steal sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal information. Spyware can be delivered to your device through various methods, such as software backdoors, phishing, spoofing, manipulative marketing, software packages, Trojans, and mobile apps 1.

            </p>
            <p>The process of spyware operation typically follows a three-step process:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Infiltration</p>   
                <li>Monitoring and Capture</p>    
                <li>Sending or Selling</p> 
            </ul>
