        <h2>What is Malware?</h2>
        <p>Malware, short for malicious software, is a broad term that encompasses any software designed to cause harm to computer systems, networks, or users. 
            It's created by cybercriminals with malevolent intent and can vary in complexity and severity. 
            Malware can include viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware, adware, and more. 
            In this section of the many different malware, we are focusing on viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware and spyware.</p>

        <h2>How Does Malware Work?</h2>
        <p>Malware operates in several ways to achieve its objectives. It can modify, delete, or steal data; disrupt system performance; control infected machines remotely; or use internal algorithms to further propagate and evade detection. 
            It often goes unnoticed until it has already caused significant damage.</p>

        <h2>How is Malware Distributed?</h2>
        <p>Malware exploits vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks to gain entry. 
            It can be distributed via infected email attachments, compromised websites, peer-to-peer networks, infected USB drives, social engineering tactics, and more. 
            Once inside a system, it may release additional payloads or download other malware components.</p>

        <h2>About Viruses</h2>
        <p>A virus is a type of malware that attaches to another program and, when executed, usually inadvertently by the user, replicates itself by modifying other computer programs and infecting them with its own bits of code. 
            Viruses can spread across systems when users share infected files. They often cause damage to the system, corrupting files or affecting system performance. 
            Viruses can also create a backdoor for cybercriminals to access the system, leading to potential data theft. </p>
    
        <h2>About Trojans</h2>
        <p>Trojan, or Trojan horse, is a type of malware that disguises itself as a legitimate software or file to trick users into installing it. Unlike viruses, Trojans do not replicate themselves but instead create a backdoor for cybercriminals to access the system. 
            Once installed, a Trojan can perform actions such as modifying, deleting, or stealing data, disrupting system performance, or creating a backdoor for additional malware components to be installed. 
            Trojans are commonly distributed through infected email attachments, malicious downloads, or compromised websites.</p>
